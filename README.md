## 🔒 Why is the Code Private?

The source code for Version 1 is intentionally kept private because:

- I am currently building **Version 2** with major improvements  
- I want to maintain uniqueness and prevent unauthorized reuse  
- This repo exists only to **showcase** the project, not share code  

When Version 2 is live, its showcase will also be public (code will still remain private).

## 🚀 Upcoming Version 2 (In Progress)

Version 2 of my portfolio will include:

- 🎨 Completely new UI design  
- 🌙 Dark / Light theme  
- ✨ Smoother animations  
- ⚡ Better performance  
- 📊 Enhanced project presentation  
- ⭐ More interactive components  

Stay tuned!
